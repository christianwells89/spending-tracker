I wanted to have a little icon for each currency's banknote but couldn't find ones I liked. So my
backup plan is having flags, which is just as good. I found these but couldn't get SVG without
paying but it doesn't matter too much for a self-hosted site.

To get more go to https://icons8.com/icon/pack/flags/office and get the 30px versions.
